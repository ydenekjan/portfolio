    <h1>Education.</h1>
    <h2>Grammar School.</h2>
    <p>From the age of 11 I attended my local grammar school which I finished in 2023.
        <br>
        <br>
        I graduated top of my class in IT, Mathematics, English and Czech.</p>
    <h2>Unicorn University.</h2>
    <p>
        In 2023 I chose to apply to Unicorn University in Prague. My decision was influenced mostly by the practical and modern approach compared to other school in Czechia.
